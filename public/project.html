    <p> The goal of this project is to create vizualisation objects, such as a Treemap and a DAG, and be able
    to add an interaction between those two. It is designed to facilitate the interpretation of the data.</p>
    
    <h3> What is a Treemap ?</h3>
    <p> A treemap is a visual method for displaying hierarchical data that uses nested rectangles to
    represent the branches of a tree diagram. Each rectangles has an area proportional to the amount
    of data it represents. </p>
    
    <h3> What is a DAG?</h3>
    <p>A graph is formed by a collection of vertices and edges, where the vertices are structureless
    objects that are connected in pairs by edges.
    In the case of a directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex.
    A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph that has no cycles.</p>
